      <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>
    Hi! I'm <strong>Ashutosh Ojha</strong>, an aspiring <strong>Software Engineer</strong> 
    and <strong>Computer Science undergraduate</strong> with a strong interest in 
    <strong> Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, and Financial Technology</strong>.  
    I enjoy building projects that combine problem-solving, creativity, and impactful 
    applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the last few years, I’ve worked on diverse projects — from developing 
    <strong> AI-powered applications</strong> like crop disease detection and 
    drug discovery systems, to creating <strong>web-based platforms</strong> for 
    interactive career visualization. During my Codsoft internship, I developed 
    tools like an <strong>ATM Interface, Number Guessing Game, and Student 
    Grade Calculator</strong> in Java, which sharpened both my programming and 
    logical thinking skills.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond coding, I bring <strong>leadership qualities</strong> and teamwork 
    experience — having volunteered for social initiatives and worked in hackathon 
    environments where collaboration, fast learning, and innovation are key.  
    My long-term goal is to excel in the <strong>finance and AI industry</strong>, 
    blending technology with financial systems to create intelligent, scalable, 
    and user-friendly solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe in continuous learning and adaptability — qualities that help me 
    stay ahead in this rapidly changing tech world. I'm always excited to explore 
    new tools, frameworks, and research to enhance both my technical and personal growth.
